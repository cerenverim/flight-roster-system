# Flight Roster System

## Project Synopsis
An online tool called the Flight Roster System is intended to be used in the creation and administration of flight rosters for fictitious airlines. In order to ensure effective flight preparation and administration, it makes it easier to organize flight information, such as passenger lists and assignments for the cockpit and cabin personnel.

### Features 
- **Flight Selection:** Users have the option to filter flights based on a variety of parameters or choose flights based on their unique number.
- **Roster Views:** Provides tabular, plane, and expanded views, among other views, for roster data.
- **Automated Crew Assignment:** Complies with specified limitations and supports both automated and manual flight and cabin crew assignment.
- **Seat Assignment:** This feature automatically assigns seats to travelers, giving those without reserved seats extra priority.
- **Export Data:** enables the export of roster data in the JSON format for usage outside of the system.
